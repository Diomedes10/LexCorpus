# LexList

[LexList](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexList) records and associates Ethereum accounts for legal code quality and access rights.

## LexList for Ethereum Contracts

LexList is currently governed by LexDAO MYSTIC, a 43-member DAO of vetted members distributed 1:1: [0x057e820D740D5AAaFfa3c6De08C5c98d990dB00d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x057e820d740d5aaaffa3c6de08c5c98d990db00d#code).

Starting with ERC-20 tokens, LexList shall serve to register LexDAO impressions on contract quality: [0x374fBeFE7cD832dd5745E1D741d661C91D0B5106](https://etherscan.io/address/0x374fBeFE7cD832dd5745E1D741d661C91D0B5106/code#code).

## LexList for Ethereum Accounts

### LexAIR

Beyond qualifying the quality and operations of Ethereum contracts, LexDAO can serve to register ORG and individual user accounts as "Accredited Investors." 

LexDAO MYSTIC currently governs and qualifies LexDAO members for legal licensure and standing with their local bar associations by issuing non-transferrable LXLAW tokens (operated on LexToken "Lite" contract): [0x3e6D94F5eB600a83366EEedb1Ac374972eD8f763](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e6D94F5eB600a83366EEedb1Ac374972eD8f763#code). 

LXLAW holders can access and update the LexAIR registry: [0x6FAfAD57060201d8Fac9D190d4f42Ef1e68494c2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e6D94F5eB600a83366EEedb1Ac374972eD8f763#code).
