**DAO CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT**

This DAO Contributor Agreement (the “**_Agreement_**”) is entered into between the organization known as **[Name of DAO]** (the “**_DAO_**”) and the contributor named on the signature page hereto (the “**_Contributor_**”) as of [Date of Agreement] (“**_Effective Date_**”). The DAO and the Contributor agree as follows:


1. **Services**.  The Contributor agrees to consult with and provide such services to the DAO from time to time as are mutually agreed by the parties (the “**_Services_**”). 


2. **Consideration**.  As the sole consideration due to the Contributor for the Services, the DAO will provide such stablecoins or other cryptocurrency or assets as the DAO and Contributor shall separately agree (the “**_Payment_**”), provided, however, that Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the amount, form and timing of the Payment is subject at all times to modification pursuant to the DAO’s governance framework. In no event shall the DAO be responsible for any fees or other payments to the Contributor except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. [The Contributor shall also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable, documented expenses for which the Contributor receives prior written approval from the DAO.]


3. **Ownership**.  The Contributor shall own all intellectual property and related rights throughout the world that arise in whole or part out of, or in connection with, the Services or any Proprietary Information (“**_Inventions_**”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contributor shall grant the DAO a free, nonexclusive license to use the Inventions.


4. **Proprietary Information**.  The Contributor agrees that all Inventions and other business, technical and financial information (including, without limitation, the identity of and information relating to DAO’s members, contributors or grant applicants) the Contributor obtains from or assigns to the DAO, or learns in connection with the Services, constitute “**_Proprietary Information_**.” The Contributor will hold in confidence and not disclose or, except in performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the DAO, use any Proprietary Information. However, the Contributor shall not be so obligated with respect to information that (i) the Contributor can document is or becomes readily publicly available without restriction through no fault of the Contributor, or (ii) that the Contributor knew without restriction prior to its disclosure by the DAO. Upon termination or as otherwise requested by the DAO, the Contributor will promptly return to the DAO all items and copies containing or embodying Proprietary Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing nondisclosure obligations, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), the Contributor shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.


5. **Termination**.  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, by giving the other written notice (including email). Notwithstanding any such termination, Sections 2 through 8 of this Agreement and any remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration.


6. **Relationship of the Parties; Promotional Rights**.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of this Agreement, each party shall be and act as an independent contractor and not as a partner, joint venturer, agent or employee of the other and shall not bind nor attempt to bind the other to any contract. The Contributor shall not be eligible to participate in any of the DAO’s employee benefit plans, fringe benefit programs, group insurance arrangements or similar programs. The DAO may use and authorize the use of the Contributor’s name (as represented to the DAO by the Contributor) in promotional materials, websites and the like. The DAO will confirm in writing with the Contributor should the Contributor’s name be shared “publicly”, publicly defined as available to anybody via the world wide web without any direct sharing or password protections on pages. The Contributor will also follow protocol for online social media posting and sharing that the DAO shares and may update from time to time.


7. **No Conflicts; Enforcement of Policies.**  The Contributor represents and warrants that neither this Agreement nor the performance thereof will conflict with or violate any obligation of the Contributor or right of any third party. [The Contributor acknowledges and agrees that all members of and contributors to this DAO are responsible for ensuring that every other member and contributor follows the DAO’s Code of Conduct (the “**_Code_**”), as available on the DAO’s [Notion] page and previously made available to the Contributor. The Contributor agrees that if they witness a violation of the Code, they will report it to an administrator or similar authority designated by the DAO, which may include a registry or other protocol for automating disclosures and dispute resolution ("**_Administrators_**"). The Contributor further acknowledges that if they do not follow the Code, the Administrators may edit the Contributor’s posts and remove them from the DAO and/or the DAO’s online coordination systems. Whether to take any enforcement action is in the complete discretion of the Administrators.]


8. **Waiver of Claims; Limitation of Liability**.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party (the “**_Indemnifying Party_**”) shall indemnify the other party and such other party’s affiliates (each such person an “**_Indemnified Party_**”), against, and hold them harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) suffered or incurred by any such Indemnified Party arising from or relating to any failure by the Indemnifying Party to comply with any applicable agreement or obligation under this Agreement or the breach of any representation or warranty given herein. In addition, the Contributor acknowledges and agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly take any action against a DAO member or contributor under a general partnership theory of liability.


9. **Miscellaneous**.  This Agreement and the Services performed hereunder are personal to the Contributor and the Contributor shall not have the right or ability to assign, transfer or subcontract any obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of the DAO. Any attempt to do so shall make the Agreement void. The DAO shall be free to transfer any of its rights under this Agreement to a third party. Any breach of Sections 3 or 4 will cause irreparable harm to the DAO for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore, the DAO shall be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies. This is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and no changes or modifications or waivers to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or other applicable law) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [the State of Delaware] without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. Any notice shall be given in writing by electronic mail or posting to the DAO’s online coordination systems (including, but not limited to, Discord or Telegram) and addressed to the party to be notified at the e-mail address or username as the party may designate by 10 days’ advance written notice to the other party.
