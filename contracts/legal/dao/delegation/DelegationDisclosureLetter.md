Re: \[PROTOCOL\] Delegation Services

Dear \[NAME\]:

This letter memorializes the agreement (the "**<u>Agreement</u>**")
between \[TOKENHOLDER ENTITY\] ("**<u>Tokenholder</u>**") and
\[DELEGATE ENTITY\] ("**<u>Delegate</u>**"), pursuant to which
Tokenholder will delegate a portion of its Governance Rights (defined
below) to Delegate and Delegate will use those Governance Rights to
participate in the governance of the \[PROTOCOL NAME\] protocol
("**<u>Protocol</u>**").

**WHEREAS**, \[TOKEN\] (\[TOKEN SYMBOL\]) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain
located at address 0x\[TOKEN ADDRESS\] that empowers community governance of the Protocol (the
"**<u>Token</u>**");

**WHEREAS**, the Token confers on its holders the right to debate,
propose, and vote on all proposals relating to the Protocol as determined by 
the governor contract located at 0x\[TOKEN GOVERNOR ADDRESS\]
("**<u>Governance Rights</u>**"), as well as the right to delegate
those Governance Rights to others;

**WHEREAS**, Tokenholder owns Tokens and wishes to delegate a portion
of its Governance Rights in order to ensure the active and
decentralized governance and development of the Protocol by those with
expertise in and knowledge of the Protocol and its related technology;
and

**WHEREAS**, Delegate has represented and Tokenholder has determined
that Delegate has particular knowledge and expertise regarding the
Protocol such that it is beneficial to the Protocol for Tokenholder to
delegate a portion of its Governance Rights to Delegate to participate
in Protocol governance.

**NOW THEREFORE**, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

1.  **<u>Delegation.</u>**

    a.  Promptly following the date first written above ("**<u>Effective
        Date</u>**"), Tokenholder shall delegate to Delegate the
        Governance Rights pertaining to \[AMOUNT\] Tokens (the
        "**<u>Delegated Portion</u>**"). Delegate shall provide
        Tokenholder with a wallet address to receive the Delegated
        Portion as well as any other instructions, information or
        assistance necessary to effect this delegation.

    b.  From time to time the parties may mutually agree in writing to
        increase or decrease the Delegated Portion by any amount.

2.  **<u>Participation.</u>**

    a.  Delegate shall use the Delegated Portion to participate in
        Protocol governance matters in a manner that it reasonably deems
        to be in the best interest of the Protocol.

    b.  Delegate shall use its best efforts and conduct appropriate due
        diligence in the course of such participation.

    c.  Delegate shall keep Tokenholder generally informed as to the
        team members engaged in Protocol governance matters on its
        behalf and shall provide reasonable notice to Tokenholder of
        material changes to this team.

    d.  All parties acknowledge that Delegate's participation in
        Protocol governance shall be in the sole discretion of Delegate,
        and Tokenholder has not and will not provide voting instructions
        or otherwise attempt to directly or unduly influence Delegate's
        participation in Protocol governance matters. Delegate will
        under no circumstances be required to vote in alignment with
        Tokenholder or any of its other Token delegates.

    e.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
        relationship between the parties of a partnership, joint
        venture, or any other similar arrangement, or to render either
        party liable for any debts or obligations incurred by the other.

3.  **<u>Reimbursement for Expenses and Services Related to Participation.</u>**

    a.  In connection with the exercise of Governance Rights as
        contemplated in this Agreement, Delegate may be required, among
        other things, to monitor and participate in community
        discussions regarding changes to the Protocol and research and
        review code related to certain proposed changes to the Protocol
        (the "**<u>Delegation Related Services</u>**"), and may also
        incur expenses and other costs in the course of performing such
        Delegation Related Services.

    b.  As consideration for the Delegation Related Services,
        Tokenholder agrees to compensate Delegate in an amount equal to
        \$\[AMOUNT\][1] per month during the term of this Agreement.

4.  **<u>Limitation of Liability.</u>**

    a.  In no event shall either party be liable to the other concerning
        the subject matter of this Agreement, regardless of the form of
        any claim or action (whether in contract, negligence, strict
        liability or otherwise), for any (a) loss or inaccuracy of data,
        loss or interruption of use, or cost of procuring substitute
        technology, goods or services, (b) indirect, punitive,
        incidental, reliance, special, exemplary or consequential
        damages including, but not limited to, loss of business,
        revenues, profits and goodwill or (c) damages, in the aggregate,
        in excess of \$\[AMOUNT\], even if such party has been advised
        of the possibility of such damages.

5.  **<u>Communications; Proprietary Rights.</u>**

    a.  Neither party shall make any public statements regarding this
        Agreement or use the other party's name or logo without the
        prior written consent of the other party, unless required by
        applicable law or for audit or tax purposes; provided, however,
        that either party may disclose publicly that the Delegated
        Portion has been delegated to Delegate.

    b.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a license
        of intellectual property or other proprietary rights from one
        party to the other. Each party shall retain all right, title,
        and interest in and to its intellectual property and all of its
        financial, business, legal, and technical information that by
        the nature of such information would be understood by a
        reasonable person to be proprietary or confidential.

6.  **<u>Term and Termination.</u>**

    a.  The initial term of this Agreement shall be \[NUMBER\] months
        from the Effective Date (the "**<u>Initial Term</u>**").
        Thereafter this Agreement shall automatically renew for
        successive \[NUMBER\] month periods (each, a "**<u>Renewal
        Term</u>**" and together with the Initial Term, the
        "**<u>Term</u>**"), provided that neither party has notified the
        other party in writing at least \[NUMBER\] days prior to
        expiration of such Term that it wishes to not renew the
        Agreement, in which case the Agreement will terminate at the end
        of such Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 4, 5, 8,
        and 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

    b.  Tokenholder may only terminate this Agreement prior to the
        expiration of the Term in the event that Delegate materially
        fails to satisfy its Protocol governance duties described in
        Section 2 herein, including, without limitation, continued
        non-participation in material votes, and does not cure such
        breach within \[NUMBER\] days.

    c.  Delegator may terminate this Agreement for any reason or no
        reason, upon providing \[NUMBER\] month's written notice to
        Delagatee.

    d.  Following the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement by
        either party, Tokenholder will revoke the Delegated Portion in
        full. In such case, Delegate shall provide any assistance
        reasonably requested by Tokenholder for the purpose of revoking
        and returning the Delegated Portion and terminating this
        Agreement.

7.  **<u>Entire Agreement; Amendment; Severability.</u>**

    a.  This Agreement is the final, complete, and entire agreement of
        the parties. There are no other promises or conditions in any
        other agreement, oral or written. This Agreement supersedes any
        prior written or oral agreements between the parties.

    b.  The Agreement may only be modified or amended if the amendment
        is made in writing and is signed by both parties.

    c.  If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper
        authority to be unenforceable or invalid such unenforceability
        or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or
        invalid as a whole and in such event, such provision shall be
        changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives
        of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of
        applicable law or applicable court decisions.

8.  **<u>Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.</u>**

    a.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed exclusively in
        accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
        regard to its conflicts of laws provisions or rules. The parties
        hereby agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
        appropriate federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
        located in the County of New York,
        New York, as a forum for litigation. Each of the parties
        hereto hereby waives all right to trial by jury in any lawsuit,
        action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of this
        Agreement.

9.  **<u>Counterparts; Notice.</u>**
