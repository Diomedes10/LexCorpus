**2.1**	*Transfer Restriction Rules.*

(a)	The Grantee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Joint Venture, Transfer any Locked Tokens, except that this clause ‘(a)’ shall not be deemed to prohibit Grantee from:

(C)	Grantee shall not engage in staking of Locked Tokens through the services or facilities of a custodial cryptocurrency exchange, third-party staking protocol (*i.e.*, any protocol or smart contract not included in the Protocol), or other person, service or technology having custody or control over the Locked Tokens or any Representational Protocol Tokens received as rewards for staking Locked Tokens, in each case, other than the Smart Contract Escrow;

(ii)	Transferring Locked Tokens:

(A)	by will or intestacy to the Grantee’s Family Members upon Grantee’s death; or

(B)	during the Grantee’s lifetime, to a trust solely for the benefit of Grantee’s Family Members, provided, in each case, that such Family Members, trust or other transferees first execute an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Joint Venture, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement that then remain applicable to such Locked Tokens;

*or*

(iii)	having Locked Tokens that are staked in a deployed Protocol Instance in accordance with the preceding clause ‘(i)’ slashed, burned, reclaimed, auctioned or otherwise utilized by such deployed Protocol Instance pursuant to the security or incentivization mechanisms included in such Protocol Instance.

(c)	The Joint Venture may (but shall have no obligation to), in whole or in part, waive, shorten or terminate any or all of the Transfer restrictions set forth in this Section 2.1 (‘Transfer Restriction Rules’).

(d)	Any Transfer or attempted or purported Transfer in breach or violation of this Section 2 (‘Transfer Restrictions’) shall be null and *void ab initio*.

**2.2**	*Token Unlocking Schedule.*

(a)	At each time, each Granted Token shall either be an “Unlocked Token” or “Locked Token”. On the Grant Date, all of the Granted Tokens are Locked Tokens.

(b)	A Granted Token shall not simultaneously be both an Unlocked Token and a Locked Token. Once a Granted Token has become an Unlocked Token, it shall never become a Locked Token.

**2.3**	*Escrow of Locked Tokens.* As a non-exclusive enforcement mechanism for the Transfer restrictions set forth in this Section 2 (‘Transfer Restrictions’), Grantee agrees that the Granted Tokens shall be deposited into a smart contract on the Designated Blockchain System (the “Smart Contract Escrow”). The Smart Contract Escrow shall be reasonably designed to automatically make available to the Grantee any Granted Tokens that have ceased being Locked Tokens and become Unlocked Tokens.

**2.4**	*Nerfing of Award Eligibility for Locked Tokens.* Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in order to foster decentralization of governance powers over and economic benefits in the Protocol, any Protocol Instance or any DAO, the Joint Venture may arrange, in its discretion (e.g., through technical features of the Smart Contract Escrow or otherwise) that Grantee is not entitled to receive additional Protocol Tokens that would ordinarily be issued to a Protocol Token holder by a Protocol Instance or DAO (through rebate mechanisms, fee mechanisms, incentive award mechanisms, or otherwise) in connection with Grantee’s staking, voting or other use of the Locked Tokens.

**2.5**	*Specific Performance; Damages not an Adequate Remedy.* It is expressly agreed between the parties that money damages are inadequate to compensate the Joint Venture for Transfers of Granted Tokens in violation of the Transfer restrictions provided under this Section 2 (‘Transfer Restrictions’) and that the Joint Venture or any Joint Venturer shall be entitled to specific enforcement of its rights to enforce such Transfer restrictions without the posting of any bond.

**3.	CERTAIN OTHER TERMS.**

**3.1**	*DAO Participation.*
 
(a)	Protocol Tokens are intended to be utilized for the Protocol Token Purposes, including to participate in DAO(s), including by creating and voting on governance proposals relating to DAO(s), the Protocol or any relevant Protocol Instance. Protocol Tokens may from time to time develop other uses. The generally accepted uses of the Protocol Tokens at any particular time are referred to herein as the “Protocol Token Purposes” and, as of the Grant Date, the anticipated generally accepted uses of the Protocol Tokens are: (i) using the Protocol Instances with which the Protocol Tokens are associated for their generally accepted purposes; (ii) accepting a proportional share of the decentralized benefits of such Protocol Instances; (iii) assuming a proportional share of the decentralized responsibility for and decentralized power over such Protocol Instances; (iv) monitoring and participating in DAOs; and (v) other generally accepted purposes of the Protocol Tokens.

(b)	Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Protocol and Protocol Instances are intended to be open decentralized finance infrastructure existing for the common good. To the extent that the Grantee elects to make use of the Protocol Tokens, Grantee will use the Protocol Tokens for one or more of the Protocol Token Purposes, acting in good faith, using reasonable care, and voting based on Grantee’s own independent judgment regarding the best interests of the community of persons who use, contribute to, or otherwise derive benefits from the Protocol and the Protocol Instances.

(c)	Grantee shall refrain from voting the Granted Tokens on proposals in which Grantee has a material, non-public conflict of interest as compared to ordinary holders of Protocol Tokens who are not similarly situated to Grantee. Grantee shall not engage in vote-buying, vote- selling, bribery or manipulation in connection with a DAO. Grantee shall not form “groups,” “voting blocs” or “voting trusts” with respect to a DAO, enter into agreements providing for the coordination of votes relating to a DAO or agree to vote the Granted Tokens based on how one or more other persons vote their respective Protocol Tokens, in each case, in a manner that would limit or otherwise adversely affect Grantee’s right or ability to utilize the Granted Tokens in accordance with Grantee’s own independent judgement regarding the merits of each individual DAO proposal; provided, however, that if a voting delegation, proxy voting or similar feature is approved by a DAO, Grantee may utilize such feature.

**3.2**	*DAO Independence; Exculpation and Release From Fiduciary & Implied Duties.* The DAO is intended to be separate and independent from the Joint Venture and each Joint Venturer. Use of the Granted Tokens for the Protocol Token Purposes by Grantee and other service providers, members, equity holders, directors, officers and agents of the Joint Venture or any Joint Venturer (“Agents”) is intended to be independent from the Joint Venture, the Joint Venturers and their respective businesses and enterprises and the other Agents. Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law after giving effect to the waivers set forth herein, when participating in a DAO or otherwise utilizing Protocol Tokens, the Joint Venture, the Joint Venturers and the other Agents shall not owe to Grantee, and Grantee shall not owe to the Joint Venture, the Joint Venturers or the other Agents, any fiduciary duties or other duties implied by law or equitable principles or imposed by applicable law (“Extrinsic Duties”). For the avoidance of doubt, subject only to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, it is acknowledged and agreed that each Joint Venturer, each Agent and Grantee may independently create and vote on DAO proposals in their respective sole discretions, including by independently voting their Protocol Tokens in favor of DAO proposals that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to Grantee or the Joint Venture, any Joint Venturer or any Agent in their capacities as such and against DAO proposals that would reasonably be expected to be beneficial to Grantee or the Joint Venture, any Joint Venturer or any Agent in their capacities as such. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law after giving effect to the waivers set forth herein: (a) no person (including the Joint Venture, any Joint Venturer or any Agent) shall be liable to Grantee for any claim arising out of, or based upon, such person’s participation in the DAO, except to the extent constituting a material breach of an express provision of this Agreement or a violation of applicable law; and (b) Grantee shall not liable to any person (including the Joint Venture, any Joint Venturer or any Agent) for any claim arising out of, or based upon, Grantee’s participation in the DAO, except to the extent constituting a material breach of an express provision of this Agreement or a violation of applicable law. To the extent that the foregoing is inconsistent with any Extrinsic Duty, the Joint Venture, each Joint Venturer, each Agent and Grantee, as applicable, hereby waives and releases, and agrees not to assert or make any claim based on, such Extrinsic Duty, to the maximum extent permissible with respect to the matters stated herein. Grantee, the Joint Venture, each Joint Venturer and each Agent hereby agree not to order, direct, compel or coerce one another to vote specific ways on specific DAO proposals or otherwise improperly interfere with each other’s independent discretion in participating in the DAO.

**3.3**	*Prohibited Token Transactions.* Grantee hereby agrees to refrain from: (a) transacting in Protocol Tokens (including selling, buying, borrowing, lending or hedging Protocol Tokens) based on relevant material non-public information; (b) engaging in any fraud, deception or participating in any manipulative or deceptive scheme relating to the Protocol Tokens; (c) making public statements, promises, assurances or predictions relating to the price or value of Protocol Tokens in a manner could reasonably be expected to create an expectation of profits in Protocol Tokens from the efforts of others; and (d) during the first 12 months following the Protocol Token Launch Date, making a market in, publicly distributing or underwriting the public distribution of Protocol Tokens (including participating in any liquidity bootstrapping AMM pool pairing Protocol Tokens with another type of token).

**3.4**	*No Implication of Future Rewards or General Compensation.* Nothing in this Agreement shall confer, or be deemed to confer on Grantee or deemed to be part of, imply or create any contractual or other right of the Grantee to future compensation, grants of awards, or benefits in lieu of awards, even if awards have been granted repeatedly in the past. This Agreement is not part of Grantee’s normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments.

**3.5**	*No Implication of Future Employment.* Nothing in this Agreement shall confer or be deemed to confer on Grantee any right to an employment or other Service relationship with the Joint Venture or any Joint Venturer or to limit in any way the right of the Joint Venture or any Joint Venturer to terminate Grantee’s employment or other Service or relationship at any time, with or without cause.

**3.6**	*No Fiduciary Relationship.* Nothing set forth in this Agreement and no action taken pursuant to any of them shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between Grantee and the Joint Venture, any Joint Venturer, any Agent or any other person.

**6.5**	*Severability.* Any term or provision of this Agreement that is found invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

**6.8**	*Waivers, Delays or Omissions.* No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such non-breaching or non- defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.
